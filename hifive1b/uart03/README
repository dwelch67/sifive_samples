This is really a clock example.  Switches to the 16Mhz oscillator,
finding out that even though this one appears to be 17MHz from the
RC oscillator, a divisor that works for a while one day doesnt work
so well the next.  So switching to the external 16Mhz oscillator.

Echos back what comes in.

Skeleton for future RC oscillator based programs.
