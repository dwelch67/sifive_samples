Using the free running timer.

0x80000 is 16 seconds 32768hz

Okay this makes sense now there is a block called AON or always on
both the freerunning timer (register MTIME) as well as the RTC are in
this block and this block is driven by either an internal 32768Hz or
an external clock.  Which clock on boot is determined by a strap pin

AON PSD LFCLKSEL 

32 kHZ clock source selector. When driven low, AON PSD LFALTCLK input
is used as the 32 kHz low-frequency clock source.  When left unconnected
or driven high, the internal LFROSC source is used.

The hifive board has it driven low.  So the external 32768 oscillator
is used.  So both of those timers are going to run at 0x8000 ticks per
second, so 0x80000 is 16 seconds.
