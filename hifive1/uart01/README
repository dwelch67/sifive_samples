I really really like this UART.  Been waiting for one of these for a
long time.  No frills, just does 8N1, set the divisor, enable, done.

Saying that I slammed into a brick wall of failure for a while.  They
say an amoswap instruction CAN be used.  Well couldnt get it to work
without using it.  And not using it as a swap, that didnt work just
using it to do the write.

The nstop bit was interestingly set on reset, so tried with it clear,
one stop bit, didnt work so well, with it set, works quite nicely.  So
perhaps a bug or perhaps dont ask and just leave it set.

Learned a little more like these core csr registers like mcycle which
is a running cpu cycle counter.  (freerunning clock based on the
cpu clock).  So with this built in interesting pll clock thing that
says we should be around 13.8 or so MHz, well if you measure oscillator
based mtime ticks to mcycle ticks, mine was over 16MHz almost 17MHz.
There is a 16Mhz crystal on this board which I have not switched over
to but using the 16Mhz divisor worked fine with the internal oscillator.
So far.
