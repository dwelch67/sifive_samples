The schematic shows an RGB led on gpio pins 19, 21 and 22.  They ground
the led so making the gpio low makes that led light up and making the
gpio high turns the led off.

The reset state of the gpio appears to be all inputs, just forcing
registers for all the gpio pins carelessly to get them blinking.
